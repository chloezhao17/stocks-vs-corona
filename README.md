## Chosen Topic

We will be analyzing different sectors in the stock market to see how their stock prices have changed due to the CoronaVirus pandemic.

## Data Sets

We will be using the yfinance python library to pull yahoo finance data and store it in a sql-lite server. [yfinance link](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)

Example sets of stocks we will be pulling are below:

| Airlines (JETS)         | Tech (XLK)       | Utilities (VPU) | Retail (XRT) | Media (XLC) | Travel/Transporation (AWAY) |  (MISC)   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- | --------- |
| Delta (DAL)             | Microsoft (MSFT) | ---             | ---          | ---         | Uber (UBER)                 | ZOOM (ZM) |

## Final Design Sketch

We will incoporate a dropdown list that allows the user to select the stocks they would like to see graphed. The user will also be able to input date ranges to view the stocks. They will also be able to select time spans from a set of buttons (ie. 1 month, 3 months, 1 year, etc.)
